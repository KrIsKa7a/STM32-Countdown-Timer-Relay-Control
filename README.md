# STM32-Countdown-Timer-Relay-Control
This repository contains the schematic and source code of a device which is working as Countdown Timer with Relay Control. The device is connected with PC via USB interface and the countdown time can be set via Serial Terminal ([**RealTerm**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/) for example). Countdown is started via user interface on the PC and high power consumer can be powered until the time pass. There are also LED indications for COM success using blue LED and for Relay Status using red LED. The remaining time is displayed on 4-digit 7-segment LED indicator.
